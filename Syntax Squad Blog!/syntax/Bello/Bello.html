                I really love the song "Time of our lives" by Pitbull and Ne-Yo because it gives me energy and motivation
                whenever i listen in to it. The beat is upbeat and fun, and the lyrics remind me to enjoy the present moment though 
                despite all the challenges i face in life. It feels like a celebration of youth, reminding me that even if thing are 
                not perfect, i can still make memories and have fun. I chose this as one of my favorite songs because it lifts up my 
                mood, and makes me feel like i should treasure every moment i have with my friends and love ones.

               <dl>This video is a glimpse of the quality time I get to spend with my baby cousin—a time
                filled with laughter, play, and endless love.Every moment with him teaches me patience,
                responsibility, and the beauty of caring for someone who looks at the world with such 
                innocence and wonder.Babysitting is not just about watching over him, it is about creating
                memories, and being part of his small but meaningful milestones.The joy of
                hearing his giggles, seeing his bright eyes light up, or even just holding his tiny hands
                makes me realize how important family bonds are.These moments may pass by quickly, but the
                love and lessons they bring will stay in my heart forever.This video is not only a record 
                of time spent babysitting—it is a story of love, growth, and the special bond that only family
                can bring.
