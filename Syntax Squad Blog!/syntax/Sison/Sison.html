                <dl>So basically my music has deep meanings, I was really just vibing to the beat and the tone since
                I like this kind of musics. So it’s about a girl fantisizing her crush and what she wants her
                crush to do to her. It's in Korean so I don't even understand, haha.</dl>

                and the chaotic hilarity of Steal a Brainrot. Whether you're into style, strategy, or pure randomness,
                hese games are my ultimate boredom busters—and maybe they’ll be yours too. Tara na gow gow gowww!
