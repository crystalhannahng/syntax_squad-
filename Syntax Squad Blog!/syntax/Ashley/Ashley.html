                     My chosen favorite song is <i><b>‘I Like Me Better’ by Lauv</b></i> because I really enjoy its chill and relaxing vibe. 
                     The lyrics are simple yet meaningful, and the melody gives off a positive and comforting feeling. 
                     It’s one of those songs that I can listen to anytime, whether I’m studying, commuting, or just relaxing. 
                     It always puts me in a good mood, which is why I chose it as my favorite.
