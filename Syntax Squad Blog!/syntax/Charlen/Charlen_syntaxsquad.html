                <b>“As You Find Me” by Hillsong UNITED</b> is my favorite song because it speaks straight to the heart. Every 
                time I listen to it, I'm reminded that God's love doesn't wait for me to be perfect—He meets me right where I am. 
                Even in my struggles, doubts, and weaknesses, His grace remains constant.

                This song inspires me to keep going, to trust, and to believe that I am enough in His eyes. It's more than worship
                —it's a reminder that I am deeply loved, accepted, and valued no matter what. Every lyric feels like God whispering, 
                <i>“You are mine, just as I find you.”</i>

                Every week, I take a journey that's more than just a commute—it's an adventure. From the busy streets where I 
                ride a jeep, to the calm waves I cross by boat, and the final stretch on a motorbike leading me home to Talim 
                Island—each trip feels like stepping into a new chapter of my story.

                This blog is where I share those rides—the challenges, the quiet moments, the beauty of travel between two 
                worlds: the fast pace of student life in STI and the serene life back home on the island. If you're curious 
                about unique travel routes, island living, or simply finding meaning in the paths we take, then welcome aboard 
                my weekly journey.
            </p>
